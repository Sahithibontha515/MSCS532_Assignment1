# Insertion Sort (Descending Order)

This repository contains a simple implementation of the **Insertion Sort algorithm** that sorts elements in **monotonically decreasing (descending) order**.

## ðŸ“Œ What is Insertion Sort?

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is efficient for small datasets and is easy to implement.

> In this version, the array is sorted in **descending order** (from largest to smallest).

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

For each element in the array, Insertion Sort compares it with elements before it and inserts it into its correct position such that the array remains sorted (in decreasing order).

---

To run the code
```bash
python InsertionSort.py
